## Moore's law

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years


## End of Moore's law

* Temperature increases as power increases
* Power increases as transistor density increases.
* Voltage scaling reduces (dynamic) power consumption.
* Voltage scaling cannot prevent leakage power loss.
* Voltage scaling is limited due to noise or threshold voltage.
